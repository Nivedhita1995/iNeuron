    "Insufficient raw data: Feature construction is needed to derive new features that better represent the underlying relationships in the data.\n",
    "Non-numeric data: Many machine learning algorithms operate on numerical data. If the input data contains non-numeric features such as categorical variables (e.g., colors, categories), text, or images, feature construction is necessary to convert or transform these non-numeric features into numerical representations that can be processed by the algorithms.\n",
    "Missing or incomplete data: Feature construction techniques can be used to impute missing values or create features that capture information about missingness. \n",
    "Non-linear relationships: In some cases, the relationship between the features and the target variable may not be linear. Feature construction techniques, such as polynomial features or interaction terms, can be applied to capture non-linear relationships and improve the model's ability to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "Domain knowledge incorporation:Feature construction allows incorporating domain knowledge by creating features that encode specific insights or relevant transformations.Dimensionality reduction: When dealing with high-dimensional data, feature construction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or feature selection methods can be employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data. \n",
    "In summary, feature construction is required in situations where the raw data is insufficient, non-numeric or incomplete, where non-linear relationships need to be captured, where domain knowledge is valuable, or where dimensionality reduction is necessary for effective modeling."
