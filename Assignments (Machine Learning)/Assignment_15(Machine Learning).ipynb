    "OOB error is a way to estimate the performance of a random forest model without the need for a separate validation set. It is based on the idea of using the samples that were not included in the training of each individual decision tree, known as out-of-bag samples.\n",
    "The OOB error is calculated by evaluating the prediction accuracy of each tree on its corresponding out-of-bag samples. The predictions of all the trees are aggregated, and the overall OOB error is computed. This error estimate gives an indication of how well the random forest is likely to generalize to unseen data.\n",

    "Variable importance is a measure that indicates the relative importance of each input variable (feature) in the random forest model. It provides insights into the contribution of variables towards the prediction accuracy.\n",
    "Variable importance can be used for feature selection, as it helps to identify the most relevant features for the target variable. It also provides insights into the underlying relationships between the features and the outcome."
