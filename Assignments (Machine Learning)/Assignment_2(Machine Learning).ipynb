    "-> Observational Learning: Also known as social learning or vicarious learning, observational learning occurs when individuals acquire new behaviors or skills by observing and imitating others.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Experiential Learning: Experiential learning emphasizes the role of direct experience in the learning process. It involves learning through hands-on activities, real-world situations, and personal reflection. \n",

    "Output Type: In classification, the output is a categorical or discrete variable that represents the class or category to which an instance belongs.

In regression, the output is a continuous or numerical variable that represents a value or quantity. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its features.\n",

    "Prediction vs Estimation: Classification is concerned with predicting the class or category to which an instance belongs.

It focuses on finding the functional relationship between input variables and the output variable.\n",

In regression, the learned relationship between input and output is represented by functions such as linear regression, polynomial regression, or more complex models like neural networks.\n",

    "Evaluation Metrics: Classification and regression use different evaluation metrics. In classification, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are commonly used to measure the model's performance. In regression, metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared are used to measure the difference between predicted and actual numerical values.\n",
