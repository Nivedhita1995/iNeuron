A higher purity indicates that the clusters are more internally consistent in terms of class membership.\n",
    "Silhouette width: Silhouette width is a measure used to evaluate the quality of clustering results. It takes into account both the cohesion within clusters and the separation between clusters. The silhouette width ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better-defined and well-separated clusters. A silhouette width close to 1 suggests that the data points are well-clustered, while values close to 0 indicate overlapping or ambiguous clusters.\n",

Each weak learner is trained on a subset of the data, with more weight given to the misclassified instances in each iteration. Boosting focuses on improving the performance of the model on misclassified instances, leading to a strong overall model.\n",
    "Bagging: Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble learning technique where multiple independent copies of a base model (e.g., decision trees) are trained on different subsets of the data created through bootstrap sampling. The predictions from each model are combined, usually by averaging, to make the final prediction. Bagging helps to reduce the variance and improve the stability of the model by considering multiple subsets of the data.\n",

    "3. The eager learner vs. the lazy learner\n",
    "Eager learner: An eager learner, also known as an eager classifier, eagerly constructs a model during the training phase by analyzing the entire training data. Examples of eager learners include decision trees, naive Bayes, and neural networks. Eager learners require the complete training data to build the model, and once trained, they can quickly make predictions on new instances.\n",
    "Lazy learner: A lazy learner, also known as an instance-based learner or memory-based learner, defers the learning process until it receives a prediction request. Instead of building a general model during training, a lazy learner memorizes the training instances and uses them directly during the prediction phase. Examples of lazy learners include k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and case-based reasoning systems. Lazy learners have minimal computational overhead during training but can be slower during prediction as they need to search the training instances to make a decision."
