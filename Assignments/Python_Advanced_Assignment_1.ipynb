    "#Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "-> Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "-> OOPs is based on the concept of \"objects\". The object contains both data and code: Data in the form of properties (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of methods (actions object can perform).\n",
    "-> An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. Python programming language supports different programming approaches like functional programming, modular programming.\n",
    "-> One of the popular approaches is object-oriented programming (OOP) to solve a programming problem is by creating objects."
